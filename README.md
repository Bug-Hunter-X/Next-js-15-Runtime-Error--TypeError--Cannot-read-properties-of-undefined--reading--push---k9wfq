# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in a Next.js 15 application after deployment to a production environment. The error, 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')', points to the react-dom.development.js file and is not consistently reproducible during local development.

## Bug Description
The error manifests only in the production build and is not present in development mode. The application seemingly works as expected during local development but fails immediately upon deployment.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Build the application using `npm run build`.
4. Deploy the application (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).  
5. Observe the runtime error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution was to identify the potential cause of undefined state within the application's React components.  Ensuring proper data fetching and error handling eliminates the 'undefined' state. Thoroughly checking for undefined values before accessing them helps prevent this issue.  Further investigation can involve checking your data fetching mechanisms for potential race conditions, especially with server-side rendering.  A dedicated debugger might assist in identifying the specific component and state causing the error in production.
